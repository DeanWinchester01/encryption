# encryption
This project is something I started doing in class while I was bored. I wanted to make an attempt at encrypting messages as good as I possibly could without using anybody elses work.
There were a few versions, the first version being easily cracked, but my 3rd and final attempt was too hard for my teacher, although I could have made it better
